# Linux Security & Administration Home Lab (Ubuntu + Windows 11)

Hands-on portfolio project built to develop and showcase **Linux system administration and security monitoring skills**.  
This lab series demonstrates practical experience with **user and group management, filesystem permissions, SSH hardening, and authentication log analysis** in a VirtualBox environment.  
Each lab includes step-by-step actions, commands, screenshots, and documented security findings.

---

##  Architecture
- **Host OS:** Windows 11  
- **Hypervisor:** VirtualBox  
- **Virtual Machines:**  
  - Ubuntu Server (user management, permissions, SSH, logging)  
- **Networking:**  
  - NAT (internet access)  
  - Host-Only (used where available; SSH testing when functional)

##  Labs

### **Lab 1: Linux User Management, Sudo Configuration & SSH Hardening**
**Goal:** Create and manage Linux users and groups, configure role-based sudo access, enforce password complexity, and harden SSH access on Ubuntu.

- Created users and role-based groups (`opsadmin`, `devteam`, `analytics`)
- Assigned group memberships and validated access
- Enforced password complexity using `libpam-pwquality`
- Configured sudo access securely with `visudo`
- Hardened SSH by disabling root login and reviewing SSH settings
- Tested SSH access from Windows host (network limitation documented)

 Folder: '/lab1-user-mgmt'

### **Lab 2: Linux Filesystem Navigation & Permissions**
**Goal:** Explore Linux filesystem layout and configure shared project directories with secure permissions and collaborative access.

- Reviewed Linux filesystem hierarchy and disk usage
- Created shared project directories under `/srv/projects`
- Configured group ownership and permissions using `chgrp` and `chmod`
- Implemented setgid to enforce inherited group permissions
- Tested file creation behavior across users
- Audited permissions using `stat`, `umask`, and `find`

 Folder: `/lab2-filesystem-permissions`

### **Lab 3: Linux SSH Log Analysis (Failed & Successful Login Monitoring)**
**Goal:** Analyze SSH authentication logs by generating failed and successful login attempts and reviewing system logs.

- Generated failed SSH logins using invalid users
- Performed successful SSH login as a valid user
- Analyzed authentication events using `journalctl`
- Reviewed persistent logs in `/var/log/auth.log`
- Verified SSH logging verbosity (`LogLevel VERBOSE`)
- Identified log patterns associated with brute-force and unauthorized access attempts

 Folder: `/lab3-linux-log-analysis`
